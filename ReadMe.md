This Python project automates the generation of professional payslip PDFs for employees and sends them directly to their email addresses. It reads data from an Excel file, calculates net salary, formats a printable payslip using `fpdf`, and sends it via Gmail using `yagmail`.

Ensure your Excel file (employeepayslips2.xlsx) has the following columns exactly as listed below:

Employees Id	Name	Email	Basic Salary	Allowance	Deductions
1001	John Doe	john@example.com	1000	200	150
Notes:

Values under Basic Salary, Allowance, and Deductions should be numerical.

📤 Gmail Setup (Important!)

C:\Users\uncommonStudent\OneDrive\Desktop\PYTHON\Payslips
Each file is named using the format:

🚀 How to Run the Project
Place your Excel file and logo (optional) in the same directory as the script.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the project folder and run:

bash
Copy

python generate_payslips.py
You’ll see logs for each email being processed and sent.

🛠️ How It Works
Data Loading:
The script reads employee data from the Excel file and strips unnecessary whitespace from column headers.

Validation:
Checks if all expected columns are present.

Calculation:
Computes Net Salary = Basic Salary + Allowance - Deductions.

Payslip Generation:
Uses fpdf to create personalized PDF payslips.

Storage:
Saves PDFs in the specified target directory. Automatically creates the folder if it doesn’t exist.

Email Sending:
Sends the PDF as an attachment using yagmail with Gmail SMTP.
